## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass / SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I also gained experience in using JavaScript to fetch and manipulate JSON data, ensuring the dashboard updates dynamically based on user interaction.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to refine my understanding of advanced JavaScript concepts, particularly in managing state and optimizing performance.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks: A Complete Guide to Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - This guide was instrumental in helping me understand CSS Grid, which I used extensively in this project.
- [MDN Web Docs: Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) - This resource helped me implement the fetch functionality to load data dynamically.
